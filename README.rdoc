= NiftyCal

NiftyCal is a Ruby on Rails plugin that is designed to make viewing a calendar easy
within your application. The motivation behind this is that I couldn't find a
calendar solution that suited my needs so I figured, what the hell, I'll just dive in
and make my own. While creating this I had a few things in mind:

 * There should be an easy way to just display a calendar
 * The user should be able to accept the default days or specify there own start and end dates.
 * Every aspect of the calendars css class selectors should be customizable.

With these things in mind I set out to create what I believe is the best calendar
solution ( mainly because I created it :^d ).

== Installation

To install NiftyCall run this command from your application root:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/tschmidt/nifty_cal.git

If you are using older versions of rails you will need to download and install the
plugin into the vendor/plugins path of your application.
