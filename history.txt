== 0.1.4 2008-11-18
* 1 tiny enhancement
  * There was an issue where the calendar would not display if the time frame was
    end of the year to the beginning of the year (December to January for example).
    This was due to the way that I was calculating the padded days and the total number
    of days. There will be a better fix for this in the future.

== 0.1.3 2008-11-18
* 2 tiny enhancements
  * Modified the labels for the options. This should make them more meaningful when
    using them with #display_calendar.
  * Also removed the options comment for now. The information was not accurate.

== 0.1.2 2008-11-18
* 2 tiny enhancements
  * Supplied styles for the modern.css file.
  * Added the ability to pass an array as the result of the #display_calendar block.
    This will allow the user to pass (for the time being) an options hash with a key
    of :class and the value being the class that they want applied to the td for the
    day being modified.
